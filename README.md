# True-or-False
I am passionate about learning programming languages and want to share my experiences with you and learn from you too.
I thought about learning together with you guys and want to teach each other something and that's why I created GitHub.

I am also happy to accept suggestions for improvement

Motto: learning is experience. Everything else is just information.
At the moment I am studying C # intensively, but also Python.
